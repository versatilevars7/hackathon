                "description": "David guides you through utilizing Fivetran to extract data from the Facebook Insights API into a Snowflake database. The Fivetran \"raw\" data tables in Snowflake will be queried for Part 1 of the project (keep an eye out for Part 2). Second, he'll guide you through building a dashboard with the initial agreed-upon views in Looker where the Looker project is integrated into GitLab to track our progress/changes. So\u2026is the architecture truly that simplistic? Yes! Let's map the technology stack to our plan.\n\nThe primary focus of this project was data movement/integration. Still, we felt giving the code repository, and visualization aspects would help you understand the full system development life cycle. We faced the biggest challenge in understanding the data catalog and building use cases (looks) from the catalog. This was a fun implementation as we gained some experience in understanding how Facebook Insights operates and the breadth of data available.\n\nWe plan to do Part 2 for this project. We will implement additional data integration concepts such as dbt (Data Build Tool) to transform the raw data into reporting-friendly data structures. This will allow us to separate the staging area from the information delivery area properly. Please share any ideas regarding the project. We'd be happy to review the ideas and possibly introduce them in a later post. \n\nRead the blog post version of this Megabyte: https://medium.com/hashmapinc/extracting-facebook-insights-via-fivetran-and-snowflake-5b8f9330d909\n\nSnowflake Utilities & Solution Accelerators: https://www.hashmapinc.com/snowflake-utilities-accelerators\n\nHashmap's Snowflake Focus Page: https://www.hashmapinc.com/snowflake\u200b\n\nHashmap's Fivetran Focus Page: https://www.hashmapinc.com/fivetran\n\nLearn more about how Hashmap can accelerate your cloud and data strategy here: https://www.hashmapinc.com/\u200b\n\nReach out to Hashmap if you want to take your data architecture to the next level! https://www.hashmapinc.com/reach-out\u200b\n\nCheck out more Hashmap content:\n- Hashmap on Tap Podcast: https://www.hashmapinc.com/hashmapontap\u200b \n- Hashmap's Blog: https://www.hashmapinc.com/blog",

                    "description": "David guides you through utilizing Fivetran to extract data from the Facebook Insights API into a Snowflake database. The Fivetran \"raw\" data tables in Snowflake will be queried for Part 1 of the project (keep an eye out for Part 2). Second, he'll guide you through building a dashboard with the initial agreed-upon views in Looker where the Looker project is integrated into GitLab to track our progress/changes. So\u2026is the architecture truly that simplistic? Yes! Let's map the technology stack to our plan.\n\nThe primary focus of this project was data movement/integration. Still, we felt giving the code repository, and visualization aspects would help you understand the full system development life cycle. We faced the biggest challenge in understanding the data catalog and building use cases (looks) from the catalog. This was a fun implementation as we gained some experience in understanding how Facebook Insights operates and the breadth of data available.\n\nWe plan to do Part 2 for this project. We will implement additional data integration concepts such as dbt (Data Build Tool) to transform the raw data into reporting-friendly data structures. This will allow us to separate the staging area from the information delivery area properly. Please share any ideas regarding the project. We'd be happy to review the ideas and possibly introduce them in a later post. \n\nRead the blog post version of this Megabyte: https://medium.com/hashmapinc/extracting-facebook-insights-via-fivetran-and-snowflake-5b8f9330d909\n\nSnowflake Utilities & Solution Accelerators: https://www.hashmapinc.com/snowflake-utilities-accelerators\n\nHashmap's Snowflake Focus Page: https://www.hashmapinc.com/snowflake\u200b\n\nHashmap's Fivetran Focus Page: https://www.hashmapinc.com/fivetran\n\nLearn more about how Hashmap can accelerate your cloud and data strategy here: https://www.hashmapinc.com/\u200b\n\nReach out to Hashmap if you want to take your data architecture to the next level! https://www.hashmapinc.com/reach-out\u200b\n\nCheck out more Hashmap content:\n- Hashmap on Tap Podcast: https://www.hashmapinc.com/hashmapontap\u200b \n- Hashmap's Blog: https://www.hashmapinc.com/blog"

Randy has delivered multiple official Zero to Snowflake and Data for Breakfast sessions with Snowflake and will be working with the same material used during the Snowflake Summit World tour.\n\nWe recommend using a fresh account for this session to ensure you have full access to the entire instance.\n\nHashmap\u2019s Snowflake Focus Page: https://www.hashmapinc.com/snowflake\nSnowflake Utilities & Solution Accelerators: https://www.hashmapinc.com/snowflake-utilities-accelerators\n\nReach out to Hashmap if you want to take your data architecture to the next level! https://www.hashmapinc.com/reach-out\nCheck out more Hashmap content:\n- Hashmap on Tap Podcast: https://www.hashmapinc.com/hashmapontap\n- Hashmap\u2019s Blog: https://www.hashmapinc.com/blog"
